# ERC721
ERC721 with solidity and compiler and deployer
# compiler and deployer
i wrote the compiler and deployer of the contract with the latest changes of web3.js
you can log the module.export of the compile.js file and see the bytecode and ABI
the current deployer of the contract uses the rpc of goerli and you should put your private key in the code so deploy.js can use your account to deploy on goerli, dont forget that you should have some amount of goerli ether in your wallet to pay for the fee.

in our university there is a concept called student parenting. every new student that comes to Amir Kabir has a student parent who is one year ahead of them and helps them to get through the challenges that they may face on their way of education. this contracts gives student parents the ability to sell their child or buy childeren from other parents.<br>
there is a json format that gets name, student number and other information and then we upload it to IPFS and then put the IPFS id in the field of minting the child nft.
